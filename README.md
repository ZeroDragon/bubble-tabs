Bubble Tabs
===========

Bubble tabs keeps your newest used tab always in the first position.  
Every other tab is pushed to the right, rendering all your tabs in most-used order.  

Also it automatically deletes older tabs after a threshold defined by the user.  
In the popup you can configure how many tabs you want to keep in memory (default 10).  
Or if you want to disable the automatic deletion at all (default: false)

It also keeps a log of most resent deleted garbage-collected tabs (only the ones that
were deleted by this extension, not every deleted tab).  
This list is limited to 50 elements (currently not configurable by design).  
Each element of the list can be deleted individually or delete all at once.
